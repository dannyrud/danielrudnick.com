The game features a snake that the player controls, navigating through a defined window area to eat fruits (apples) and increase in size. The primary objective is to eat as many fruits as possible without hitting the walls or the snake''s own body. The project uses object-oriented programming principles, and a linked list data structure.',

My work focused on building and optimizing features for the SWG, a low-latency proxy server written in C++ and hosted directly on users'' laptops. One of my primary contributions was implementing advanced malware detection to inspect HTTP responses and proactively block harmful downloads before they were written to disk. I also collaborated with a team of engineers to enhance session security by encrypting cookies for critical sites. Beyond core development, I designed and built Python-based test servers using Flask and Quart and integrated web APIs to log and analyze user traffic, enabling companies to make data-driven decisions and strengthen their security strategies.',
